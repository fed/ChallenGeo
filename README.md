# ChallenGeo

This is a simple, minimalistic geography-related app. ChallenGeo has two core components, first one aiming at providing information on countries (flags, population, capital city, currency, languages spoken there and so on) whereas the second is some sort of quiz that shows the user a flag / capital city / language / etc. and they have to answer which country they correspond to.

## UX Wireframes and Comps

<table style="text-align: center;">
	<tr>

		<td><img src="/docs/ux_2.jpg" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Data Source

This app doesn't have its own backend since it makes use of the [restcountries.eu RESTful API](http://restcountries.eu) for country information, as well as [GeoNames' bank of flags](http://www.geonames.org) instead. Please reach out to either website to get more info on endpoints and data provided.
